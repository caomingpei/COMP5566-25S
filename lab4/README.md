In the 4th Lab tutorial, we will use [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) to reproduce typical attacks towards Ethereum smart contracts.

## Environment requiremet
1. You need to prepare a computer with Linux OS or deploy a Linux VM image in your computer.
2. Follow the [instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to install **Foundry** on your equipment.
3. Clone and install code scripts for this lab:
   - `git clone https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiVulnLabs.git`
   - `cd DeFiVulnLabs`
   - `git submodule update --init --recursive`
  Now you can find scripts for playing numerous attacks in dict `./DeFiVulnLabs/src/test/`
